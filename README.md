# notes
### important timbral factors
* harmonic structure
  * how equally spaced the partials are
* spectral shape
  * how rapidly does the spectral energy diminish while moving towards higher partials
  * average spectral shape can be captured by a spectral "centroid" or spectral "center-of-gravity"
* formant structure
  * this is like the "bumpiness" of the spectrum
  * e.g. lets us differentiate between "aaaa" and "eeee"
* spectral variation in time
  * attack and decay
  * this variation in time will apply to all features above, i.e. harmonic/formant structure and spectral shape
### what is the dimensionality of a model of timbre?
  * each
